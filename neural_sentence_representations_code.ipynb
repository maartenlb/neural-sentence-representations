In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."
